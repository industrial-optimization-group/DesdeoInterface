# Physical interface for desdeo framework

The arduino is loaded with standard firmata: found from arduino ide -> file -> examples -> firmata -> standard firmata

## Todo
* Less noise with potentiometers
    * Filtering
* How to connect multiple arduinos together and get the input to python from each one nicely
* Better dynamic steps with rotary encoder

## Next meeting
* Things working:
    * Sliding potentiometer
    * Rotary encoder
* Questions:
    * Does someone know how to send and handle signals in python, would this be beneficial for the phys interf
