These files were used in the beginning of this project.
Most of these are now obsolete as converting values is now handled in node itself and the data coming from serial
is in different form than it was before. 

The crc8 checker in SerialReader module is still viable and should be used.

Will be moving most of the files to obsolete folder soon.
